About Me
This is an 'About Me' guessing game page that prompts the use with questions using IF/ELSE statements. I utilized html, css, and js to build and publish this page. Once you enter the site, there is a paragraph about the author.

Reflections and Comments

Submissions Questions:

I felt like this lab went pretty well. I feel comfortable with IF/ELSE statements and feel better about my exposure to CSS. My eye for fine tuning my code is getting more refined and I'm noticing small things like, spaces, semicolons, and missing brackets. Feeling a little confused about < div> and classes and when to use them and how they link to CSS but some things sort of clicked when I set up the sticky footer. It took me around 3-4 hours to complete this assignment with small breaks in between. I expected it to take less time, but I really wanted to pay attention to CSS and JS details, and wanted to hit some of the stretch goals.

Learning Journal Questions:

I have never thought about the ways in which adults learn differently than children. Personally, if I am not motivated or see how learning something new will overall affect my life I am less willing to take the time to learn whatever that may be. I am extremely interest motivated and if I am not engaged I will have a hard time retaining the information. From what we learned today, I feel extremely motivated and excited to build on my new skills. I also recognize that there is so much information that it is impossible to rely solely on our instructor. I plan to try to always hit stretch goals, and to spend time learning extra things in CSS and JS that may not be covered in class. I think measuring what I learn come naturally, but i look forward to these learning journals to be a useful guide in measuring and evaluating what I have learned.
