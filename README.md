Submissions Questions:

I felt like this lab went pretty well. I feel comfortable with IF/ELSE statements and feel better about my exposure to CSS. My eye for fine tuning my code is getting more refined and I'm noticing small things like, spaces, semicolons, and missing brackets. Feeling a little confused about < div> and classes and when to use them and how they link to CSS but some things sort of clicked when I set up the sticky footer. It took me around 3-4 hours to complete this assignment with small breaks in between. I expected it to take less time, but I really wanted to pay attention to CSS and JS details, and wanted to hit some of the stretch goals.

Learning Journal Questions:

I have never thought about the ways in which adults learn differently than children. Personally, if I am not motivated or see how learning something new will overall affect my life I am less willing to take the time to learn whatever that may be. I am extremely interest motivated and if I am not engaged I will have a hard time retaining the information. From what we learned today, I feel extremely motivated and excited to build on my new skills. I also recognize that there is so much information that it is impossible to rely solely on our instructor. I plan to try to always hit stretch goals, and to spend time learning extra things in CSS and JS that may not be covered in class. I think measuring what I learn come naturally, but i look forward to these learning journals to be a useful guide in measuring and evaluating what I have learned.

Lab Submission-
I definitely struggled with this one! I am feeling comfortable with  html and CSS, however, JS is sill clicking. I got really stuck on the nested loop, and had help from a TA, and we were both stumped as to why my alert wasn't working. When i console.log it should that the answer was running 3 times for every one entry. I will try to ask about this in class tomorrow! I wasn't able to add too much CSS, but did style my lists.

My life experience prior to this field was super hands on. I am a jeweler, musician, and former art restoration intern. All of those fields are extremely reliant on playing around to find the correct solution. Problem solving is probably my favorite thing about those fields which is why I have leaned into web development. It will be a learning curve to problem solve with language in this way, but I feel confident that my prior skills and excitement will get me far. I will miss tactile problem solving but am looking forward to how my craft and art practice will fit into this new endeavor.
