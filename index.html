      <h1>About Ella</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p> Hello! My name is Ella Svete. I am originally from Ventura, California but moved to Olympia, Washington about eight years ago. I focused on jewelry design and art restoration in college. I have been a devoted musician in touring bands for the past seven years, which resulted in working food service jobs and never honing in on a career. After graduating from college, I started my own jewelry brand, E. Svete Collections, and have been making and selling jewelry while working part-time in a vintage clothing store for the past two years. I am eager for a career that merges my various interests and I am excited to discover new pockets in the art and music world where my new skills can thrive, while also having a sense of stability and structure. </p>
